# WpfLocalization-2009
Provides an intuitive way to localize a WPF application.

This project includes a WpfLocalization library that provides a markup extension (XAML) which can be used to localize a WPF application in an easy and intuitive way. It was inspired by earlier attempts in this field and provides various features intended to make the live of WPF developers easier.

The extension was initially developed in 2009 (after an earlier version in 2008) and published in 2011 on CodeProject.

Documentation: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/249369/Advanced-WPF-Localization

Since its publication developers who found it useful made various requests including:
- Support for using the extension in Style.Setters
- Support for Microsoft Expression Blend 4
- Better support for VB.NET
- Better cleanup of localized values that are no longer in use (e.g. after controls have been removed)

These and other issues may be addressed in a future version of the extension.
